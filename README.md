# COVAT
Collection of Various Attractor Types (in 2D).

## Introduction
Attractors are plots of unique equations. They are created by iterating over an equation multiple times and using the result at each iteration to plot a point. The result is then fed back into the equation. After millions of points have been plotted, fractal-like structures begin to appear. Over time, the repeated points fall into a basin of attraction that forms the unique shape.

## Attractors
Below are the list of implemented attractors:
